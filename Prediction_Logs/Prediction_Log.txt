  If you are loading a serialized model (like pickle in Python) generated by older
  XGBoost, please export the model by calling `Booster.save_model` from that version
  first, then load it back in current version.  There's a simple script for helping
  the process. See:

    https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/saving_model.html

  for reference to the script, and more details about differences between saving model and
  serializing.
