# What is Wafer sensors ??

The inputs of various sensors for different wafers have been provided. In electronics, a wafer (also called a slice or substrate) is a thin slice of semiconductor used for the fabrication of integrated circuits. The goal is to build a machine learning model which predicts whether a wafer needs to be replaced or not(i.e., whether it is working or not) based on the inputs from various sensors. There are two classes: +1 (working condition) and -1 (Not working to replace)

# Demo

- This repository represents **" Wafer Fault in Sensors "**.
- With the help of this project we can detect the Wafer Fault on  **Different Sensors**.
- "-1" represents Good "1" represents Bad Wafer check below image

## üìù Description

- In this project we have used **KMEANS**, **RANDOM FOREST** and **XGBOOST** for Fault Detection.

## ‚è≥ Dataset
- Download the dataset for custom training
- https://github.com/ameerkings123/Wafer_Sensors_Fault/tree/main/Training_Batch_Files
- Download the file and Place it into **" Training_Batch_Files/ ".** folder.
